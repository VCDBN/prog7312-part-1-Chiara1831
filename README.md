Once you click the start button, the application will take you to a new page where it will allow the user to choose between three tasks: Replacing books, Identifying areas, and Finding call numbers. The second two are disabled for now, only Replacing Books works. Underneath Replacing Books will be an explanation of what the user can expect when doing the task.

Once you click “Replacing Books”, you will be taken to a new page where the task takes place. The application shall randomly generate 10 different call numbers and display them to the user. 
The application shall allow the user to reorder the call numbers in ascending order, and the application shall check whether the user got the ordering right. To arrange the call numbers in ascending order, the user simply must click the items from list box 1 to list box 2. If the user makes a mistake, they can click the item in list box 2 and it will go back to list box 1.

When the user clicks on “Check Order”, the application will either display an error message or a information message depending on whether the user got it right or wrong. If the user got it right, their progress bar will go up by 15 points. If they got it wrong, they don't get any points. The third list box uses the bubble sort algorithm to show the answer to the user so that they are able to see where they went wrong. If the user wishes to do the task again, they can simply click on the “Generate Call Numbers” button. If the user wishes to go back to the selection page, they can simply press the “BACK” button.
